Feature: osquery attacks for local node
  Background:
    Given "osquery" is installed

  Scenario: Using tcp syn ping scan and the nmap fast flag
    When I launch an "osquery" attack with:
      """
      select name from os_version
      """
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      Debian
      """
